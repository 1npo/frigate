# Frigate

A Yahtzee-themed roguelike deckbuilding game inspired by Balatro

>[!NOTE]
> This is a proof-of-concept. If the idea works out and turns out to be fun, I plan to polish it, re-write it in Kotlin, and release it on app stores. Maybe I'll even make a website or something.

## Motivation

I created Frigate because I love Balatro, and I really wanted to play a game that applies similar roguelike deckbuilding mechanics to Yahtzee instead of poker. I wanted to work on a personal software project I'd actually use regularly, so that I'd stay motivated to keep working on it until it was "finished", and Frigate fit the bill.
